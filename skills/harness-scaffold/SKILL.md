  Given a /goal prompt (from meta-loss-function-development) and
  a project root, scaffold the harness tree: verifiers/,
  instruments/, design tasks with deterministic graders,
  AGENTS.md, GOAL.md, README.md, and the held-out grader
  directory. The output is a runnable project in <5 minutes
  for a fresh human or agent.

  Load this skill whenever the user pastes a /goal prompt and
  says "scaffold the project", "set up the harness", or
  describes a fresh project root to use. Also load it when
  the user wants to add a new design task or held-out task
  to an existing project.

# Harness Scaffold

Given a /goal prompt and a project root, this skill scaffolds
the harness tree. Output is a runnable project: `verifiers/`,
`instruments/`, `AGENTS.md`, `GOAL.md`, `README.md`, design
tasks with deterministic graders, and the held-out grader
directory (off-limits to the agent).

**This skill runs in the meta-session, not the loop session.**
The meta-skill (`meta-loss-function-development`) drives this
skill during rounds 0-6 of the harness build, *before* the
/goal prompt is emitted. The loop session that runs the
outer loop never calls this skill — the harness is already
finished by the time the loop session sees it. This is the
core invariant of the v1.1 meta-skill: the harness is
finished before the /goal prompt exists.

**This skill writes stubs. The meta-skill is responsible for
filling them in before the /goal prompt is emitted.** The
stubs the scaffold produces are explicit `// TODO: meta-fill
before emitting /goal prompt` markers, not silent
placeholders. The completeness checklist
(`meta-loss-function-development/references/harness-completeness-checklist.md`)
is what the meta-skill walks through to ensure every stub
becomes a real implementation before the /goal prompt
leaves the meta-session.

The scaffold is **driven entirely by the /goal prompt** —
nothing is hard-coded. The skill parses the prompt for the
target, constraints, runtime, design tasks, and held-out
tasks, and produces the matching tree.

## How the user invokes this

The user has a /goal prompt (from `meta-loss-function-development`)
and a project root path. They say:

> "Scaffold the harness at `<project-root>` from this
> /goal prompt: <paste>"

The skill:

1. Parses the prompt to extract the design tasks, held-out
   tasks, runtime (which agent), and budget.
2. Creates the project tree at the project root.
3. Generates `AGENTS.md`, `GOAL.md` (the prompt itself),
   `README.md`.
4. Generates `verifiers/cline-wrapper.sh` (or the runtime
   equivalent), `verifiers/run-design-set.sh`,
   `verifiers/instruments/*.sh`,
   `verifiers/compute_sub_losses.py`,
   `verifiers/parse_cline_output.py`.
5. Generates `verifiers/private/grader.sh` (chmod 700) with
   stubs the user fills in.
6. Generates the design tasks at `test-tasks/design/01..05/`
   with `prompt.txt`, `<starting-file>`, and `grade.sh`
   stubs.
7. Generates the held-out task placeholders at
   `test-tasks/held-out/h01..h10/` (just the directory
   structure — the user fills in the actual files).
8. Writes a `README.md` with run instructions.

The fresh session that runs the loop doesn't have to do any
of this by hand.

## The scaffold's output layout

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Does not run in the loop session.** This skill is a
  meta-session tool. The loop session reads the harness this
  skill scaffolded; it does not scaffold or modify the
  harness itself. See the v1.1 meta-skill for the
  harness-first /goal-prompt-later invariant.
- **Does not implement the design task graders.** The meta-skill
  (or the user, working with the meta-skill) writes the
  actual `grade.sh` scripts based on the per-task
  description. The scaffold writes *stubs* that exit 1 with
  a `// TODO: meta-fill before emitting /goal prompt`
  marker. The completeness checklist enforces that no stubs
  remain when the /goal prompt is emitted.
- **Does not implement the held-out tasks.** Same reason —
  the meta-skill (or the user) provides them. The scaffold
  creates empty directories with a `README.md` placeholder.
- **Does not write the candidate skill.** That's the
  agent's job during the loop.
- **Does not run the loop.** That's a separate skill
  (`loop-driver` — out of scope for this skill, but
  documented in the meta-loss-function-development skill).

## Parsing the /goal prompt

The scaffold uses regex to extract the structured sections
of the /goal prompt. The format is the one from
`meta-loss-function-development/templates/goal-prompt.md`:

- `**Target.**` block → design set + held-out set
- `**Constraints.**` block → budget
- `**Instruments.**` block → instrument names
- `Design-set tasks` numbered list → design task paths
- `Held-out tasks` named `h01`...`hN` → held-out task paths
- `Harness layout` code block → file tree
- `First action` numbered list → bootstrap steps

If parsing fails on a section, the scaffold emits a default
and a `// TODO: user-fill` comment in the file.

## Per-platform behavior

The scaffold is shell-and-Python only. No `cline`-specific
runtime calls during scaffolding. The wrapper script
(`verifiers/cline-wrapper.sh`) calls Cline at loop time, not
at scaffold time.

The instrument scripts use `mktemp` and `/bin/bash` (POSIX
shell). They work on macOS, Linux, and WSL. Windows native
(not WSL) is not supported by the harness itself; use WSL or
WSL2.

## When to load this skill

- The user has a /goal prompt and wants the harness
  scaffolded.
- The user says "set up the loop project at <path>" with a
  goal in mind.
- The user wants to add a new design or held-out task to an
  existing project.
- The user wants to migrate a /goal prompt from one
  project root to another.

## How the skill's scripts work

`scripts/scaffold.py` (in this skill) is the executable that
the user runs. It takes:

- `--project-root PATH` (required)
- `--goal-prompt PATH` (default: `GOAL.md` in project root)
- `--runtime {cline|codex|aider}` (default: `cline`)
- `--no-private` (skip the held-out grader scaffold — for
  internal-only projects that don't need it)

The script reads the goal prompt, extracts the sections, and
writes the tree. Idempotent: re-running updates the existing
files without overwriting user-modified ones (a heuristic;
  user-modified files are detected by an `agent-edited:` marker
  in the first 5 lines).

## Idempotency and the agent-edited marker

Every file the scaffold writes starts with a header comment
like:

```
# auto-generated by harness-scaffold v1.0
# DO NOT EDIT — overwriting will lose your customizations
# re-run `harness-scaffold` with --goal-prompt to regenerate
```

Files the agent has edited during the loop get a marker:

```
# agent-edited: yes
```

When the scaffold is re-run, files with `agent-edited: yes`
are skipped. Files without it are regenerated. This keeps the
scaffold honest (you can re-run to add a new task without
losing the agent's work) and the loop safe (the scaffold
won't clobber the agent's tuning).

## Pitfalls when using this skill

- **The scaffold is a starting point, not a finished
  project.** The graders are stubs. The meta-skill is
  responsible for filling them in via the
  `harness-completeness-checklist.md` before the /goal
  prompt is emitted. A loop session that finds stub
  graders must stop and report — it must not fill them
  in itself.
- **The /goal prompt must follow the template.** Free-form
  prompts won't parse cleanly. If parsing fails, the
  scaffold emits a default and a TODO. Use the
  `meta-loss-function-development` skill to emit a
  well-formed prompt.
- **The held-out tasks are user-provided.** The scaffold
  creates empty directories. The meta-skill (or the user
  working with the meta-skill) fills in the actual task
  files. The agent must not be able to read these
  directories; the scaffold sets permissions accordingly
  (`chmod 700` on `private/`, `chmod 600` on
  `grader.sh`).
- **The wrapper script depends on the runtime.** The
  scaffold generates the Cline wrapper by default. For
  Codex or Aider, the user (or the loop driver) replaces
  the wrapper with the appropriate invocation. The
  contract is the same; only the executable path and
  flags differ.
- **Don't run the scaffold over an existing project without
  reading the diff first.** The scaffold regenerates files
  without the `agent-edited: yes` marker. If the user has
  manually edited those, those edits are lost. Use `git
  diff` after the run.
- **If you change a shell template in `scaffold.py`, the
  emitted bash can break in three subtle ways.** Empty
  `if/else/fi` clauses (syntax error), backslash-escaped
  quotes inside `python3 -c "..."` invocations (runtime
  quoting bug), and GNU-isms like `grep -P` or `sed \w`
  that fail on macOS BSD userland. See
  `references/bash-emission-pitfalls.md` for the three
  bug classes and the post-change verification recipe.
